In this module you will see a model of system of fireflies. These autonomous agents(fireflies) glow through a biological chemical reaction, periodically. However, things become interesting when each of these agents1 adjusts their light cycle upon receiving stimuli from the flashes from other agents in the system. Eventually these interactions lead to inevitable emergence of synchronous flashing of all the agents inevitably.

Just load the html file in your browser and watch the firefly show!
